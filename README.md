# Welcome to my GitHub profile

## About me:

üéì My name is Alejandro, I am a **full-stack** developer who mostly specializes in **back-end**, I studied **web development** as well as **multiplatform application programming**.

üíª I have one year of experience as a **full time back-end developer** working in **PHP**, **Java** and **JavaScript** and I am passionate about data, back-end, APIs and everything related to that world. 

üèÖ My goal is to become a professional **developer** and **data engineer**, who is capable of not only producing quality code but also provide value to my team.

üè† I live in **Madrid, Spain**, and I can speak **Spanish** as well as **English** at a C1 level. I am also currently studying **German**. I would love to work in-person, at least during these first years as a developer, although I am amenable to a hybrid schedule or even fully remote work.

## Here are some of my projects:
| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [üíª RFactor2ControlPanel](https://github.com/amedina03/RFactor2ControlPanel) | This is an application I worked on **for a client** who needed a control panel to manage his business. He operates a racing simulator renting shop and he had trouble setting up all the stations, especially when big groups came at the same time, so he requested an application that allowed him to modify data in his stations from his central computer, as well as being able to turn the game on and off and finish and end races. It is a **desktop applicaation** created using **C#** and **VisualStudio** |
| [üïπÔ∏è Unity Board Game](https://github.com/amedina03/ProyectoFinal_DAM) | This was the **final project** I worked on with one colleague during my Multiplatform Application Development studies. It is a game created in **Unity** using **C#** in which the user has to navigate through a map, getting objects to complete missions and using the advantages provided to defeat other players. |
| [üïπÔ∏è GamesMiniverse](https://github.com/amedina03/GameMiniverse) | This is a small **webpage** that I worked on during my Web Application Development studies. It is a simple webpage in which the user can play some popular minigames. It was made using plain **Javascript**, **HTML** and **CSS**|
| [üìñ JavaSpring_FromZero](https://github.com/amedina03/JavaSpring_FromZero) | This is a project I am **currently working on**. My idea is to create a series of **tasks with solutions** for people looking for fast and concise exercises to practice their **Java Spring*** skills. They range from a basic monolithic app to services, deployment of these, unit tests, custom responses, and all the core functionalities one needs to learn to work with this tool. |

I have many other repositories with projects I made during my studies, classes, school material and many practice exercises, Most of them are **private** since I didn't want to overencumber my presentation page with random projects. However **if you are interested in seeing some of them don't hesitate to contact me**.

**Thank you** for taking the time to read my presentation page.
